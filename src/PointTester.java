//In this program we are going to have you practice using the Point class.
//
//Weâ€™ve already created a Point object at (10, 5), printed it out, and moved it.
//
//First, try to run this program. Then, create your own Point at the position (2, 4) and print it out.
//
//Then move your new point 5 units in the x direction and 2 units in the y direction. Finally, print out the point again to see that it moved.

        System.out.println(point);

        point.move(5, 2);
        System.out.println(point);
